## About Me

Hi! My name is Musashi (sometimes Jacobs-) Harukawa, I'm a 2nd year DPhil candidate in politics at the University of Oxford.

My research concerns political campaigning and computational tools for social scientists. Recently, that's been focused on estimating the effect of micro-targeting and developing methods for characterizing large multimedia corpora.

Prior to graduate studies, I worked as a "Data Scientist" at a finance/IT conglomerate in Tokyo, and as an teacher in Moscow.

Lockdown hobbies include baking and tinkering with Linux.

## About this Blog

While computational tools have become an essential tool for political (and other social) science research, our research environment and support infrastructure have not caught up. Tasks that are usually handled by different teams in an IT company are all down to the researcher; you have to become your own sys admin, front end developer, back end developer, database administrator, and data analyst.

The infeasibility of this task leads to lax practices, from poor data storage/management techniques (Dropbox full of zipped CSVs anyone?) to idiosyncratic development environments. All of this hampers reproducibility and wastes time.

This blog is my notes and tutorials on the tools available to computational social science researchers, _at all stages of development_. I aim to write on topics from web development to causal inference to machine learning to academic writing, using only free/open-source software. The end goal: to save you time and help standardize reproducible research.
