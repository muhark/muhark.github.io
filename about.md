## About Me

Hi! My name is Musashi (sometimes Jacobs-) Harukawa, I'm a 2nd year DPhil candidate in politics at the University of Oxford.

My research concerns political campaigning and computational tools for social scientists. Recently, that's been focused on estimating the effect of micro-targeting and developing methods for characterizing large multimedia corpora.

Prior to graduate studies, I worked as a "Data Scientist" at a finance/IT conglomerate in Tokyo, and as an teacher in Moscow.

Lockdown hobbies include baking and tinkering with Linux.

## About this Blog

As a political science researcher at a department with few to no computational resources and a individual-focused style of research, I am usually my own IT division. Some things I have done for my research:

- Manage, package and deploy development environments.
- Build MariaDB and PostgreSQL databases for remote access.
- Create bots and web scrapers for collecting trace data.
- Train, test and deploy ML algorithms.
- Write and host a suite of tools for teaching Python remotely.
- Deploy a survey website with a custom Jupyter kernel hosting a predictive algorithm.
