I am a Research Scientist in the Emergent Artificial Intelligence Lab at Intel Labs.
My research focuses on three main areas:

- Characterizing latent social biases in large generative models
- Techniques for correcting these unwanted/unexpected biases
- Conducting large-scale multimodal model training and inference (on Intel accelerators)

Prior to Intel, I was postdoc at Princeton University working with [Professor Brandon Stewart](https://bstewart.scholar.princeton.edu), and did my PhD at the University of Oxford with Professors [Andy Eggers](https://andy.egge.rs) and [Raymond Duch](https://www.raymondduch.com).
