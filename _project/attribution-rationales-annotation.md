In this project I present a computationally-assisted method for characterizing differences in language usage between political actors, applied to eleven US presidential candidates' campaigns on Facebook between 2017 and 2020. Prior computational approaches to characterizing linguistic differences between political actors have presented these differences in terms of lexical semantics. While these strategies can be informative, they are limited in their ability to capture semantic patterns occurring at the phrase level as well as non-semantic quantities such as differences in syntax. To overcome these limitations I introduce feature attribution strategies from the interpretable deep learning subfield as a valid means of identifying differentiating patterns at both the word- and phrase-level.

I provide two theoretical contributions to political science text-as-data methodology. The first is to consider the reasoning of complex text classifiers as a theoretically interesting quantity that can be empirically validated. The second is attribution heat maps as an assistive tool in qualitative analyses of text to consider corpus-level patterns _within_ individual documents.
